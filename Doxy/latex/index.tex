 Welcome to {\bfseries{Kaffi Engine}}, a high-\/performance game engine written entirely in {\bfseries{C}}. Kaffi is meticulously designed to provide a deep dive into the core technologies of modern game development. It features full 3D capabilities from inception, is entirely open-\/source, and built with clean abstractions for seamless multi-\/platform compatibility.

Kaffi is structured to give developers a solid foundation for building games efficiently and effectively. It includes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Core Language\+:}} C
\item {\bfseries{Primary Compiler\+:}} Clang (Visual Studio\textquotesingle{}s compiler is not supported)
\item {\bfseries{Graphics API\+:}} Vulkan (Open\+GL and DirectX support planned)
\item {\bfseries{Platform Support\+:}} Windows (primary), Linux, mac\+OS (future)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The engine ecosystem consists of several distinct components\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Engine Library (DLL/\+SO)\+:}} Core engine logic as a dynamic library.
\item {\bfseries{Game Application Executable\+:}} Your actual game referencing the engine library.
\item {\bfseries{Test Bed Executable\+:}} Dedicated for testing engine features in isolation.
\item {\bfseries{Editor (Separate)\+:}} Optional, modular editor not bundled with core engine.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

To use and contribute to Kaffi, the following are recommended\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{C Language Proficiency\+:}} Understanding of C programming is essential.
\item {\bfseries{Clang Compiler\+:}} Ensures cross-\/platform compatibility.
\item {\bfseries{Game Dev Concepts\+:}} Basic knowledge of graphics APIs (Open\+GL/\+Vulkan) and game loops is beneficial.

Kaffi includes a robust initial feature set\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Build System\+:}} Lightweight and cross-\/platform.
\item {\bfseries{Low-\/\+Level Utilities\+:}} Dynamic arrays, binary trees, and string handling.
\item {\bfseries{Platform Abstraction\+:}} Seamless Windows/\+Linux support.
\item {\bfseries{Comprehensive Logger\+:}} Console and file logging.
\item {\bfseries{Flexible File I/O\+:}} Efficient handling for textures, models, and maps.
\item {\bfseries{Application Layer\+:}} Core game loop and engine subsystems.
\item {\bfseries{Advanced Renderer\+:}} Vulkan support; Open\+GL/\+DirectX planned.
\item {\bfseries{Memory Management\+:}} Custom allocators for performance.
\item {\bfseries{Scene Graph \& ECS\+:}} Hierarchical scene management with ECS.
\item {\bfseries{Profiling \& Debugging\+:}} Built-\/in utilities.
\item {\bfseries{Hot-\/\+Reloadable Code\+:}} Rapid iteration for scripts/game logic.
\item {\bfseries{Integrated Physics\+:}} Basic physics system for realistic interactions.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Kaffi is organized into modular, interdependent layers\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Platform Layer\+:}} OS abstraction for windowing, input, file access, and console output.
\item {\bfseries{Low-\/level Utilities\+:}} Memory management, file I/O, and essential data structures.
\item {\bfseries{Renderer Layer\+:}} Unified interface for graphics APIs, starting with Vulkan.
\item {\bfseries{Application Layer\+:}} Central game loop, physics simulation, rendering orchestration.
\item {\bfseries{Game Layer\+:}} Top layer for game-\/specific logic, hot-\/reload support, and test bed integration.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Getting Started}{Getting Started}}\label{index_autotoc_md10}
To compile the project, run the master build script located in the root directory\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item On {\bfseries{Windows}}, run\+: {\ttfamily build-\/all.\+bat}
\item On {\bfseries{Linux}}, run\+: {\ttfamily build-\/all.\+sh}
\end{DoxyItemize}

This will build the engine library first, followed by the testbed executable, placing all binaries in the {\ttfamily bin/} directory.
